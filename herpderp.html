      <strong>What is herpetology?</strong>
      <p id="blah">
        Not many people recognize this subject of study, and no, it is not the study of herpes.
        In fact, it is a branch of zoology which focuses on reptiles and amphibians.
        Reptiles, due to their cold-blooded nature and slithering movements (hence the root word of herpetology, "herpein", which means "to creep" in Greek), have long been demonized by the humans.
        However, reptiles and amphibians are quiet harmless and amiable creatures with huge enthusiast communities all over the world.

        <strong>Personal engagement</strong>
        <p>I've always loved reptiles since I was young, especially snakes.
          I remember throwing a fit when I was 6 years old because I wanted a pet snake.
          Of course that never happened since my parents were regular human beings who despised reptiles.
          Starting in middle school, I started researching about snakes and lizards as a hobby when I wasn't doing homeworks and studying, practicing viola, or having late-night existential crises while listening to lofi.
